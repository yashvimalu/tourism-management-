                                <h4>Baba Mandir</h4>
                                <p>Situated on the road passing between Nathu La and Jelepla Pass, at a distance of 64 km at an elevation of 
                                    4000 meters, Baba Mandir is the shrine which was built at the Samadhi of Harbhajan Singh. It is the local 
                                    belief that every person visiting the Nathang Valley and crossing through this enchantingly beautiful terrain 
                                    has to pay their respects to Baba Harbhajan Singh. Don't think of it as an ordinary temple, for you'll be mistaken!
                                    As you climb the stairs to the concrete construction,<span id="dots">...</span><!-- flanked with bells on both side, you'll be rewarded with 
                                    the most ineffable samadhi you'd have ever visited. 

                                    Legend has it that 35 years ago while leading a pack of mules from his division at Tukla to Deng Dhukla in 
                                    East Sikkim, Sepoy Harbhajan Singh went missing. After a search was launched, his body was discovered after 
                                    three days by the army. It is also believed that he was one who led the soldiers to his body. Thereafter, 
                                    many soldiers in the troop reported that Baba had been coming in their dreams asking them to build a shrine 
                                    in his memory. A samadhi was thus made in his memory and called the 'Baba Harbhajan Singh Temple'. Many people 
                                    believe Harbhajan Singh comes to the temple every night and does his rounds after putting on his uniform. 
                                    People worship him as a saint who guards the lives of soldiers along the border.
                                    
                                    Inside the Baba Mandir, you will come across a large photo of Harbhajan Singh which is worshipped by his devotees. 
                                    Tourists who come here leave their water bottle for a few days and collect it later for it is believed that by drinking 
                                    that water all the wishes come true. Harbhajan Singh's office has been built on one side of the temple with a dining place, 
                                    and a room for him to stay at with his uniform and shoes. Though the temple is present on the side of a road, it is surrounded 
                                    by magnificent mountains thereby giving an amazing view to the tourists. Baba Harbhajan Singh Temple is a must-visit due to 
                                    the tales associated with the place.--></p>

                                    lake in the East Sikkim district of the Indian state of Sikkim, some 
                                    40 kilometres (25 mi) from the capital Gangtok. Located at an elevation 
                                    of 3,753 m (12,313 ft), the lake remains frozen during the winter season. 
                                    The lake surface reflects different colours with change of seasons and is
                                    held in great reverence by the local Sikkimese people. Buddhist monks 
                                    prognosticated after studying the changing colours of the lake.<span id="dots">...</span><!--
                                    In Bhutia language the name Tsomgo is made of two words 'Tso' meaning "lake" 
                                    and 'Mgo' meaning "head" which gives the literal meaning as "source of the lake"
                                    As the lake is located in a restricted area it is essential for all Indians visiting 
                                    the area to obtain permits. 
                                    In case of foreign nationals special permit is essential.Indian Postal Service released

                            M.G Marg, also known as Mahatma Gandhi Road or MG Road, is a street which is one of the focal points 
                            for tourists in Gangtok. It's more like an extension of open shopping center or lane square where local 
                            people and visitors take leisurely strolls or simply sit and unwind on one of the numerous seats laid along 
                            the center and both sides of the street to absorb the vibe. The whole area is just a person-on-foot zone and 
                            vehicles are not permitted on this 1 kilometer stretch of the street. There's a statue that includes the figures 
                            of Bhutia Chieftain Khye Bumsa, the Lepcha pioneer Thetong Tek and his wife Ngo-Kong-ngol.</p>
